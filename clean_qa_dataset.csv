"Why do dyslexic people struggle with homophones like where, were, and we’re? Even when I explain the difference, my brother keeps mixing them up.","That’s a common challenge for dyslexic individuals because homophones sound the same but have different meanings and spellings. Since they rely more on phonetic reading, visual distinctions don’t always register immediately.
Here are a few strategies that might help your brother:
Mnemonic Tricks: Associate a keyword with each—‘where’ has ‘here’ in it (location), ‘we’re’ = ‘we are,’ and ‘were’ is past tense.
Color Coding: Highlight different homophones in different colors to reinforce their distinctions.
Sentence Anchoring: Have him practice with specific example sentences repeatedly (e.g., ‘Where is my book?’ vs. ‘We were at school.’).
Text-to-Speech Tools: Hearing the words in context helps reinforce the correct usage.
The key is repetition through different sensory methods. Would you like some printable exercises to help with this?"
"My daughter struggles with spelling, especially when she hears a word and tries to write it down. She keeps confusing similar sounds like b and d or m and n. How can I help her?","This happens because dyslexic brains process sound-symbol relationships differently, making similar sounds harder to distinguish.
Here’s what can help:
Tactile Learning: Have her trace letters in the air or on textured surfaces while saying the sound aloud.
Mirror Exercises: Use a mirror to show how the mouth moves differently when saying ‘b’ vs. ‘d’ or ‘m’ vs. ‘n.’
Letter Flip Cards: Write ‘b’ on one side and ‘d’ on the other, flipping between them to reinforce recognition.
Dyslexia-Friendly Fonts: Try fonts like OpenDyslexic that make letters easier to distinguish.
With regular practice and a multi-sensory approach, her spelling can improve significantly. Would you like recommendations for fun learning apps that reinforce these distinctions?"
"Even with spell check, I still make a ton of spelling mistakes in my work emails. Words like their and there constantly trip me up. How can I stop making these mistakes?","Spell checkers are great, but they don’t always catch errors when words are spelled correctly but used incorrectly.
Here’s how to train yourself to get it right:
Create Quick Mental Hooks: ‘Their’ has ‘heir’ in it, meaning possession. ‘There’ has ‘here’ in it, meaning location.
Use Voice-to-Text: Reading your writing aloud will make errors more noticeable.
Slow Down & Proofread Backward: Reviewing text from the end to the beginning helps catch spelling errors.
Grammarly & AI Assistants: These tools highlight context-based mistakes.
Developing these habits takes time, but you’ll see improvement. Do you want a cheat sheet of common mistakes and quick fixes?"
"Why do I struggle to recognize words when someone spells them out loud? Even simple ones confuse me.","This issue is often tied to phonological processing difficulties, which are common in dyslexia. Recognizing words in isolated letter form requires a different cognitive process than reading them as a whole.
Here’s what can help:
Chunking Method: Instead of hearing ‘C-A-T’ as separate letters, try blending them as ‘CA-T’ to recognize the word faster.
Finger Writing: Physically writing letters while hearing them reinforces memory.
Phonetic Drills: Apps like ‘Phonics Hero’ or ‘Sound It Out’ help with this.
Visualizing Words: Picture the whole word in your head while hearing the spelling.
Over time, these strategies can improve auditory word recognition. Would you like personalized practice exercises for specific words you struggle with?"
"I want to read more, but I lose focus quickly, and the words start blending together. How can I stay engaged while reading?","That’s a common challenge, especially for dyslexic readers.
Try these focus-boosting strategies:
Use a Reading Ruler or Finger Guide to isolate lines and prevent word-blurring.
Choose High-Interest Books—topics that excite you make reading more engaging.
Try Audiobooks with Text to reinforce comprehension.
Read in Short Bursts (10–15 mins) with breaks to avoid fatigue.
Use Dyslexia-Friendly Fonts & Spacing for easier reading.
Making reading more interactive helps build focus over time. Want me to recommend some dyslexia-friendly book formats?"
"Can dyslexia go undiagnosed in adults? I always struggled with reading, but I was never tested as a kid.","Absolutely! Many adults don’t realize they have dyslexia because they’ve developed coping mechanisms over time.
Signs you might have dyslexia:
Difficulty with spelling, reading aloud, or distinguishing similar words.
Frequent writing or speaking errors (e.g., mixing up words).
Slow reading speed and trouble processing new words quickly.
If you suspect dyslexia, consider an online screening test or consult a specialist for an evaluation.
Want some resources on adult dyslexia strategies?"
"Why do I take longer to answer questions in class? Even if I know the answer, my brain just freezes.","This is often due to processing speed differences in dyslexia, which can make retrieving words or forming responses take longer.
Here’s how to work with it:
Give Yourself Thinking Time: Practice pausing before answering.
Use Keywords Instead of Full Sentences—start with the main point first.
Write Key Ideas First when taking notes to speed up recall later.
Practice Rapid Response Drills to train retrieval speed.
The key is patience—dyslexic thinkers often have deep, insightful answers once given time. Would you like strategies for handling timed tests?"
"I read something, but 10 minutes later, I forget what it was about. How can I retain information better?","Retention issues happen because dyslexic readers focus so much on decoding words that comprehension takes a backseat.
Try these strategies:
Summarize Out Loud After Each Paragraph—teaching someone else reinforces memory.
Use Visual Aids (Mind Maps, Flowcharts) to organize information.
Read Along with Audio for reinforcement.
Highlight Key Points & Write Short Notes while reading.
These methods improve long-term retention. Want some interactive note-taking tips?"
"I keep confusing numbers, like 13 and 31. Is this part of dyslexia?","Yes, many dyslexic individuals also have dyscalculia, which affects number recognition and sequencing.
Here’s how to manage it:
Use a Number Grid to reinforce patterns.
Write Out Numbers in Words (‘thirteen’ vs. ‘thirty-one’).
Use Colored Number Cards to visually differentiate digits.
Would you like tools to strengthen number skills?"
"How can I follow instructions better without getting overwhelmed?","Breaking tasks into small, clear steps helps.
Ask for Written Instructions Instead of Verbal when possible.
Use a Checklist to track progress.
Highlight Key Words in instructions.
Simplifying the process reduces stress. Want a personalized task planner?"
"Anyone else have this problem? Your brain is zooming, seeing patterns, connecting the dots, but when you need a fact, you Google it, pull up the screen, and your mind goes blank. What was it I wanted to know??? Sometimes I can rebuild the thought thread, sometimes I can't!","This is actually a common cognitive hiccup, especially for people with neurodiverse thinking patterns. It's likely tied to working memory overload or executive function struggles.
Here are a few strategies to help:
Mind Mapping Before Searching: Jot down your train of thought in a notepad before opening Google.
Verbalize It: Say your question out loud before you search—it helps reinforce memory.
Use Search History: Keep a habit of reviewing past searches in your browser to retrace lost thoughts.
Note-Taking Apps: Use voice notes or apps like Google Keep to store fleeting ideas before they disappear.

"I struggle with social interactions due to my dyslexia. While I do feel empathy, I prefer being alone, dislike deep relationships, and avoid talking to colleagues. Does dyslexia contribute to this?","Yes, dyslexia can impact social interactions in subtle ways. It’s not just about reading and writing—it can affect processing speed, memory recall, and how we interpret social cues.
A few things that may help:
Structured Social Interactions: Try planned conversations with specific goals (e.g., a checklist for work meetings).
Energy Management: Recognize that socializing is exhausting—plan downtime afterward.
Alternative Communication Methods: Emailing or messaging instead of verbal conversations might help.
It’s completely valid to prefer solitude. If it’s not causing distress, you don’t necessarily need to ‘fix’ it. However, if it’s impacting work/life, social coaching or therapy can help. Want strategies for specific situations?"
"My counselor suggested that my lifelong difficulty in making and maintaining friendships may be linked to dyslexia. Has anyone else experienced this?","Absolutely. Dyslexia can contribute to social struggles due to:
Misinterpretation of Tone/Meaning: Difficulty processing fast conversations.

Use Context Clues: Focus on key words rather than every single word.
Need tips for handling this in work or school settings?"
"I hate proofreading because I literally can’t see my own mistakes. My brain just fills in the correct version. Any hacks?","Yep, this is a classic dyslexia issue—your brain autocorrects mistakes before you notice them.
Proofreading Hacks:
Change the Font & Size: It forces your brain to see the text differently.
Read Backwards: Start from the last sentence and move up.
Use Text-to-Speech: Hearing it out loud helps catch errors.
Take a Break First: Distance makes mistakes more obvious.
Want free proofreading tools that work well for dyslexic readers?"
"I zone out a lot, even when I’m interested in something. My brain just stops processing. Anyone else?","Yes! This is mental fatigue, cognitive overload, or even ADHD-like inattention. Your brain is working too hard and force-rebooting itself.

"Can someone have dyslexia without spelling or letter-recognition issues, but only struggle with whole words?","Yes, dyslexia exists on a spectrum, and not everyone experiences the same symptoms. While phonological dyslexia (difficulty processing letter sounds) is the most common, some people have surface dyslexia, where they struggle with whole-word recognition rather than letter-by-letter decoding. The issue you described—substituting, skipping, or rearranging entire words but catching your own mistakes—is more linked to visual processing or working memory issues than classic dyslexia.
Possible Causes:
Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) Deficit – Trouble processing words quickly.
Visual Processing Disorder – Difficulty with word positioning and tracking.
ADHD or Executive Dysfunction – Brain auto-completes information based on expectation, leading to substitutions.
What Helps?
Guided reading strategies (using a ruler or software like BeeLine Reader).
Text-to-speech tools (like NaturalReader) to reinforce correct reading.
Breaking text into smaller chunks to prevent word-skipping."
"What challenges do dyslexic people face while reading on digital mediums?","(Dedicated survey question—so here’s what might be expected in responses.)
Font & Layout Issues – Serif fonts and tight spacing make words harder to distinguish.
Scrolling & Eye Fatigue – Digital screens cause tracking difficulties.
Background-Text Contrast – High contrast (e.g., black text on white) can cause visual stress.
Autocorrect Dependence – Errors may not be self-corrected because spellcheck fixes them.
Possible Solutions:
Use dyslexia-friendly fonts (e.g., OpenDyslexic, Arial, Verdana).
Adjust text size, spacing, and background color.
Use speech-to-text tools to assist reading."
"Do students with dyslexia struggle more with reading recipes, and what tools can help?","Yes, because recipes require sequential processing, number tracking, and exact wording, which can be challenging for dyslexic individuals.
Common Issues:
Skipping steps due to difficulty tracking instructions.
Misreading measurements (e.g., 1/2 vs. 1/3).
Losing place while reading multi-step instructions.
Solutions:
Use visual recipe cards with step-by-step images.
Highlight key words and numbers.
Read aloud or use text-to-speech tools for auditory reinforcement."
"What could cause involuntary sub-vocalization while reading? Could OCD be a factor?","Yes, OCD and intrusive thoughts can cause an overwhelming urge to internally vocalize words, making reading exhausting. The struggle isn’t with reading itself but with compulsively narrating and fixating on words.
Other Possible Causes:
Hyperlexia – Strong reading ability but difficulty in comprehension.
Auditory Processing Issues – Difficulty filtering out internal vs. external speech.
Anxiety-Related Thought Loops – Intrusive thoughts interfering with focus.
How to Manage It?
Mindful Reading: Focus on the meaning rather than the sound of words.
Reduce Internal Vocalization: Hum while reading or chew gum to engage the mouth.
Guided Reading with a Finger or Ruler: Helps override intrusive narration.
Exposure Therapy (OCD treatment): Gradual exposure to non-vocalized reading."
"How does dyslexia affect programming, and what can help dyslexic coders?","Dyslexic programmers may struggle with:
Syntax issues: Missing semicolons, brackets, or incorrect indentation.
Word-order confusion: Mixing variable names or function calls.
Distraction from error messages: IDE highlights can be overwhelming.
How to Help:
Use a dyslexia-friendly IDE setup: Change font to Consolas/Dyslexie, modify color schemes, and turn off distracting syntax alerts.
Write pseudocode first: Helps structure thoughts before coding.
Use text-to-speech for debugging: Listening to the code can catch mistakes.
Practice in multiple languages: Some dyslexic coders find Python easier due to its readable syntax."
"What resources or exercises can help an adult with dyslexia improve verbal communication?","Most speech therapy resources target children, but adults can still improve through:
Speech-to-Text Practice: Tools like Otter.ai can reinforce correct verbal structure.
Chunking Words: Breaking long sentences into smaller parts.
Conversational Roleplay: Practicing structured dialogue to build confidence.
Reading Aloud with Pacing Tools: Apps like Voice Dream Reader can help slow down speech patterns.
For the partner (you):
Be patient—don’t interrupt or finish their sentences.
Encourage slower, more deliberate speech.
Practice back-and-forth storytelling to build fluency."
"What non-dyslexic conditions could cause slow reading, occasional word substitution, and poor comprehension?","If someone performs well on phonological tests but struggles with silent reading, the cause might not be dyslexia. Possible explanations:
Scotopic Sensitivity (Irlen Syndrome): Difficulty processing high-contrast text (e.g., black on white).
ADHD or Executive Dysfunction: Trouble maintaining focus on text.
Visual Crowding: Difficulty distinguishing letters in dense paragraphs.
Reading Speed Deficits: Some people naturally process text slower, unrelated to dyslexia.
Ways to Improve Reading Speed & Comprehension:
Use a reading tracker (finger, guide, or app like Spreeder).
Experiment with background colors and fonts.
Practice summarizing paragraphs verbally after reading."
"How can I stop writing letters too big and going outside the box when taking notes or during exams?","Problem: Some students struggle with writing too large, making their handwriting go outside the designated areas in answer sheets or notebooks. This can make their work look messy, harder to read, and even lead to lost marks in exams where writing within the space is required.
Practical Solution:
Handwriting practice on lined or graph paper: Practicing on narrow-ruled paper or using worksheets with boxes can help develop spatial awareness while writing.
Use a reference word size: Before starting, write a single word in a correct size and use that as a benchmark throughout.
Try a different pen grip: Holding the pen too far from the tip can lead to less control, making letters appear larger. Experiment with different grips.
Switch to digital note-taking: If allowed, using a tablet or laptop can eliminate handwriting constraints altogether."
"How can I improve my variable naming skills in SQL and Python to make my code clearer for coworkers?","Problem: A data analyst frequently works with SQL and Python but struggles to name variables properly, leading to confusion when sharing code with colleagues.
Practical Solution:
Follow a consistent naming convention:
Use snake_case in Python (customer_orders, total_sales).
Use camelCase in SQL (CustomerID, OrderAmount).
Avoid single-letter or vague names like x, y, data1.
Use meaningful, descriptive names:
Instead of tempVar, use monthly_revenue.
Instead of a, use customer_count.
Keep names concise but clear:
avg_price_per_item is better than average_price_for_each_individual_product_purchased.
Use comments for clarity: If a variable’s purpose isn’t obvious, add a short comment explaining it.
Use linters and auto-formatters: Tools like pylint and black in Python can enforce naming conventions."
"Is there a link between dyslexia, internal monologue, and mood regulation?","Problem: Some people with dyslexia report not having an internal monologue (talking to themselves mentally), relying more on visual thinking. This raises the question of whether a lack of internal speech makes mood regulation harder, as it limits self-reflection.
Practical Solution:
Cognitive strategies:
Journaling or voice notes can help compensate for lack of inner speech.
Mind-mapping ideas visually can help process thoughts better.
Therapy and mindfulness:
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can teach structured ways to regulate emotions without needing verbal self-talk.
Practicing mindfulness can help with emotional awareness.
Experiment with alternative self-talk methods:
Instead of verbalizing thoughts, try drawing or writing key ideas in short phrases."
"Should English dubs of foreign films be more widely accepted, especially for dyslexic viewers?","Problem: Many people criticize English dubs, arguing that movies should be watched in their original language with subtitles. However, dyslexic individuals often struggle with reading subtitles quickly, making dubbed versions necessary for accessibility.
Practical Solution:
Advocacy for accessibility in media:
Streaming platforms should highlight accessibility features for dyslexic viewers.
Encourage high-quality dubbing for better viewing experiences.
Better voice acting in dubs:
Studios can invest in better dubbing performances to reduce the stigma.
Community awareness:
Film discussions should acknowledge that some people need dubs, just as subtitles help others."
"Should I disclose my dyslexia when applying for jobs, and how can I deal with Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) that are difficult to read?","Problem: Many job applications ask whether a candidate has a disability. Dyslexic applicants worry that disclosing it might reduce their chances of being hired. Additionally, Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) are often text-heavy, making them difficult for dyslexic individuals to complete within the time limit.
Practical Solution:
Deciding whether to disclose:
If dyslexia significantly affects job performance, disclosure may help secure reasonable accommodations.
If it does not impact the job role, withholding the information may prevent bias.
Navigating SJTs effectively:
Request accommodations, such as extra time, where available.
Use text-to-speech software if the platform allows.
Take practice SJTs to become familiar with question structures.
Target companies with inclusive hiring:
Research employers that prioritize neurodiversity."
"I suspect I might have dyslexia. How do I know if I should seek a diagnosis?","Problem: Someone experiences difficulty reading aloud, frequent spelling mistakes, and word mix-ups (spoonerisms) despite excelling in academics. Stress makes their symptoms worse, and they wonder whether they should seek an official diagnosis.
Practical Solution:
Signs that a diagnosis might be helpful:
Struggling with reading or writing despite strong intelligence.
Anxiety when reading aloud or writing under time pressure.
Difficulty remembering sequences (e.g., phone numbers, addresses).
Benefits of a diagnosis:
Access to workplace or academic accommodations.
Learning specific coping strategies tailored for dyslexia.
How to get tested:
Consult an educational psychologist or neuropsychologist.
Some universities and workplaces offer testing services."

Some wonder if dyslexia has caused them to be rejected or if their partner should be informed.
Practical Solution:
How to tell your SO:
Be upfront but casual: I sometimes struggle with reading and writing due to dyslexia, but I have ways to manage it.
Share specific situations where they might notice it (e.g., slow texting, trouble reading restaurant menus).
Handling relationship challenges:
If miscommunication occurs, clarify that dyslexia might be a factor.
Use tools like text-to-speech or voice messages when necessary.
If rejection occurs:
Someone who rejects you over dyslexia likely isn’t the right partner."
"Why do dyslexic people have poor memory for certain things (like phone numbers) but great long-term memory for experiences?","Problem: Dyslexic individuals often struggle with short-term memory tasks, like recalling numbers or spelling words, but they excel in remembering events, stories, and visual details.
Practical Solution:
Leverage strengths:
Use story-based memory techniques (e.g., turning numbers into visual images).
Use audio recordings instead of relying on written notes.
Compensate for weaknesses:
Use apps to store important details.
Repeat information aloud to reinforce memory."
"When writing, I often mix up similar-looking letters (e.g., t and d). Is this a dyslexia-related issue?","Problem: Some dyslexic individuals swap visually similar letters, making handwriting errors common.
Practical Solution:
Practice letter differentiation:
Use tracing exercises to reinforce muscle memory.
Write in larger font sizes to improve clarity.
Switch to digital writing:
Typing reduces letter mix-ups and allows spell-check assistance."
"My CEO is pushing me toward a PR role, but my dyslexia affects my writing. Should I accept the challenge?","Problem: A dyslexic employee is being encouraged to take a public relations (PR) role, but they worry about their writing skills and reliance on proofreading help.
Practical Solution:
Use assistive tools:
Grammarly, Hemingway Editor, and speech-to-text can refine writing.
Improve efficiency:
Outline key points before writing to reduce errors.
Advocate for proofreading assistance:
If the job involves high-stakes writing, requesting an editor may be reasonable."
"Is dyslexia connected to difficulties in math, problem-solving, and spatial tasks?","Yes, dyslexia can impact math (often referred to as dyscalculia when specific to numbers) and problem-solving, but not in the same way for everyone. Some individuals with dyslexia struggle with number sequencing, spatial reasoning, and holding multiple steps of a calculation in their working memory.
Practical Strategies:
Use Visual Aids: Graphs, number lines, and diagrams can help with understanding mathematical concepts.
Break Problems into Steps: Writing down each step explicitly can reduce cognitive overload.
Use Specialized Tools: Apps like ModMath or Photomath can assist in structuring and solving equations.

Improve Efficiency with Tools: Use automation (Excel macros, AI-based tools) to reduce manual workload.
Seek a Dyslexia-Friendly Career: Jobs in creative fields, problem-solving roles, and hands-on professions (e.g., UX design, counseling, engineering) can be better suited."
"Why do I struggle to read out loud even though I can read and comprehend text easily in my head?","This happens due to phonological processing difficulties, common in dyslexia. Reading out loud requires coordinating multiple cognitive functions—decoding words, verbalizing them, and maintaining fluency—all at once.
Practical Strategies:
Practice with a Whisper: Read in a low voice first to reduce pressure.
Use Text-to-Speech Apps: Hearing the correct pronunciation before reading can help.
Chunk Text into Small Sections: Focus on phrasing rather than individual words.
Breath Control Exercises: Sometimes, slowing down and controlling breathing can improve fluency."
"How can I improve my spelling as an adult with dyslexia?","Spelling difficulties in dyslexia stem from phonological awareness deficits, meaning words aren’t stored in memory as easily.
Practical Strategies:
Use Phonetic Spelling Strategies: Break words into syllables (e.g., be-au-ti-ful).
Use Spaced Repetition Apps: Apps like Anki or Quizlet can help reinforce difficult words over time.
Practice Writing with Speech-to-Text First: Dictate sentences, then manually copy them to reinforce spelling.
Use Visual Memory Techniques: Associating words with images (e.g., necessary = one collar, two sleeves) can aid recall.
Set Small, Achievable Goals: Focus on the most common words used in daily life first."
"Why is dyslexia so different for everyone?","Dyslexia exists on a spectrum, with each person having unique strengths and weaknesses. Some struggle with phonics, others with spelling, while some have perfect reading comprehension but difficulty with pronunciation.
Practical Understanding:
Dyslexia Subtypes:
Phonological Dyslexia: Struggles with sounding out words.
Surface Dyslexia: Difficulty recognizing whole words.
Rapid Naming Deficit: Slow word retrieval from memory.
Visual Dyslexia: Trouble with tracking text on a page.
Tailor Solutions to Strengths: If you read well but struggle with writing, focus on audio-based note-taking. If spelling is a challenge, reinforce phonetics and word visualization."
"Are there problems that children with dyslexia have that aren’t being addressed? Can I create a software solution to help?","There are still many unmet needs in dyslexia support. Here are key gaps and possible software solutions:
Better Speech-to-Text Tools:

There’s no single app integrating speech-to-text, dyslexia-friendly fonts, voice-assisted writing, and organization tools.
Solution: A multi-purpose app combining reading, writing, and organizational tools tailored for dyslexic students.
Your background in CS gives you the perfect skill set to develop these tools. Consider working with dyslexia specialists and educators to refine ideas."
"I struggle to distinguish lengths unless I hold them close together. Is this related to dyslexia?","Your difficulty in distinguishing lengths might be related to visual processing difficulties often seen in dyslexia, but it can also be a separate condition called Dyscalculia (difficulty with spatial and numerical processing).
Here’s what you can try:
Use Reference Objects: Carry a familiar object (like a phone, credit card, or pen) to compare lengths quickly.
Increase Contrast: If possible, use objects with strong color contrast or place them against a white/black background.
Train Depth Perception: Try activities like throwing and catching a ball, stacking objects, or using apps that improve spatial awareness.
Consult a Specialist: Since most dyslexic individuals don’t report this issue, you might want to see an occupational therapist or developmental optometrist to rule out a visual processing disorder."
"Why does the dyslexia font slow me down instead of helping me? Are there better alternatives?","Dyslexia-friendly fonts like OpenDyslexic are designed to reduce letter confusion, but they don’t work for everyone. Some dyslexic people find them harder to read because they disrupt familiar letter shapes.
Better Alternatives:
Try Atkinson Hyperlegible Font: It maintains readability without distorting letters.

"My husband and I have recently started to tutor my 11-year-old nephew who is struggling in school (we are not trained teachers, just learning as we go). He is in 5th grade with his reading skill at maybe grade 1 or 2. He's failing in reading, math, and social studies, and I'm trying to find the right solution or combination of tools to help unlock his mind so he can learn.

"This is a story of corruption in Texas schools by the Texas Education Association (TEA) who is the governing body of all public schools in Texas. This is a story about my child who is being left behind as a Special Education student falling farther behind each year she is not getting her constitutional right of having a free public education. This is a story about a devoted Special Education teacher with a Master's degree who has become one of Mike Miles' latest victims in his purge of all of these experts in their field - she has 27 years of experience as a teacher in HISD. At the very least, this is a personal interest story about a student struggling in the midst of politicians and school bonds. Here's our story...","Advocacy: Here are some strategies:

"I'm dyslexic and got diagnosed quite young. Something that has often bothered me is that any resources about dyslexia tend to only focus on academics or any problems related to that. It disappoints me that dyslexia is only ever brought up in the context of what it's very bad at and never expanded outside of this area. Dyslexia is much more and is much deeper than just the problems we see in academics, and more focus should be put outside of that area. Dyslexia affects social interactions and changes a person's approach to EVERYTHING in life. Dyslexic's behavior is much different from most people's. It's not just isolated to academics.","Broader Understanding: Here are some insights:

"Hello, At least once a week, I want to commit suicide after going to therapy three times, and it completely shattered the way I view myself. A little background is that I'm dyslexic and had depression for around 3 years (18-21 years old) with bad self-esteem issues since I was 13 years old and am currently recovering from depression. I thought I was just thick and worthless for about a decade and keep regretting all the years that I've lost as a result of this. I was poorly treated by all my teachers and bullied for years on my spelling, which really affected my self-esteem and still does to this day. I'm at university at the moment but still feel misunderstood and treated as a sub-human more than half of the time. I'm constantly embarrassed and humiliated that I can't do what my peers can do and get treated differently as a result from my professors because of the misunderstandings. I'm slower at doing questions than everyone else, and it always takes me longer to complete tasks. I feel ashamed that I was put into the special exam hall and felt less of a person because of it, I just want to be normal like everyone else.","Mental Health: Here are some strategies:

"I admire this man so much. I have aphantasia and unfortunately, this means that I'm unable to enjoy any novels I read since I was a kid because of my incapability to imagine things or scenes or characters as I read. However, this man opened my eyes and heart throughout his writings since I read his Empayar series. I'm very much in love with the way he explains things, although I can't really imagine them, so each time, I have to look at his social media to see his drawings for that specific book. I wanted to meet him on 08 June (once in 6 years) but don't really know what to bring as a gift because I'm afraid letters aren't something ideal for a dyslexic person. Help me out.","Gift Ideas: Here are some suggestions:

"I wonder if anyone here relates to this. Recently, I went to get assessed for suspected ADHD, but I've never been hyper. However, I've always been profoundly inattentive, and everyone around me knows it. I went to a specialist, and she told me it wasn't ADHD, which makes sense, but that it was dyslexia instead, which got me confused. I never had reading or writing problems, but she told me that dyslexia is much more than that, and that I have the same neurological differences as other dyslexic people but without the difficulties with reading/writing. So it seems like I had some misconceptions about dyslexia, I guess?","Dyslexia Variability: Here are some insights:
Diverse Experiences: Dyslexia manifests differently for everyone, so your experience is valid.

"Hello all! I have a 7-year-old nephew (C) who I love to bits. C struggled with speech early on and has been screened several times for autism based on some specific behaviors (poor eye contact, compulsive behavior, etc.), though was ruled not to be so. He's very happy and loving, and I enjoy being his favorite aunt! Before hearing about a potential school's acceptance decision—spoiler alert for further down—I'd typed of a draft of this post asking for tips/any wisdom to help C with reading...several weeks ago, he was diagnosed with severe dysgraphia and dyslexia, with suspected ADD to boot. This wasn't a huge surprise, as—even with a private tutor—he just struggles so, so hard in school, with his 5-year-old brother already greatly ahead of him.

"We are in the beginning phases of having our son (7) 2nd grade tested for dyslexia. I myself was never tested or diagnosed, but after wondering what was wrong with me all my life, it is now becoming clear that a lot of the symptoms I experienced throughout my life were probably undiagnosed dyslexia. As an adult, I see how knowing and taking advantage of IEP programs, etc., could have been a game changer for me, but I wonder how being singled out at school or getting taken out of class might affect his confidence. He's a very social kid with a lot of confidence but also is very keen to the fact that he is different. I just want to do the best I can to convince him that his different will actually make him more special than most people in the long run. He just has to develop different skills to learn. This is sounding more like a rant/vent lol...but anyhow, does anyone have thoughts on the positives/negatives to IEP programs through CA public schools? Thanks in advance.","IEP Programs: Here are some considerations:

"My 16-year-old daughter was finally diagnosed with Orthographic Dyslexia in 6th grade after many years of tutors and tests etc. She takes advantage of supports offered by her high school and has a private tutor but is still basically white-knuckling it through the academic part of high school.

"Usually, every time I'm in a social situation, I suddenly become conscious because I'm not good with socializing. So then I try to read up on it, but then I don't get really far on the reading because I have dyslexia. So then I end up feeling sad. I'm not good with audible because I space out.

"I always struggled with reading and writing, b and d always got mixed up when I spelled. Looking back, it was super obvious that I had dyslexia, but my teachers were incompetent and could not really diagnose it. So my early childhood I got bashed by most of my teachers, test upon retest, I got treated like an idiot and I felt like one too. I was also The Weird Kid because I thought differently and did odd things. Not hard to guess that it got difficult for me to make new friends, feeling like an outcast all the time. Growing social phobia, because I always got treated like an idiot, saying weird things and overthinking. In high school, I got so severely bullied by my maths teacher, that even my classmates reported it. This is something I have no memory of, because I had completely repressed it. My mother and brother told me about it not long ago. I was struggling the most with my Swedish teacher, I have never in my life studied that hard, I knew all her books inside out, and I still failed. It completely crushed me, had to repeat a year in high school because of this. I would guess this is the point where I got my chronic depression from. All my friends moved away, feeling like a loser, no motivation left, can't find a job, severely lack confidence, it was a downward spiral. It was a hard life, but my dyslexia does not affect me much anymore, I have learned to go around it, and the fact that I am not an idiot, but actually quite smart. I am thinking about studying Psychology, but I have close to PTSD when it comes to anything related to studying. I have not decided what to do with my life yet, looking for that spurt of motivation to actually change and get out of my depression.","Overcoming Past Trauma: Here are some strategies:

"Can dyslexia be on a spectrum like autism? I have always had a very hard time reading. I get lost immediately and forget everything I just read. I listen to a TON of audiobooks though and I love them, no issues at all. When I read things, I will often read entire sections of sentences incorrectly, as if different words were written. For example, this just happened today. I DJ and put up a post about my gig tonight. Someone commented and said wish I could make your set but I won't be there until 9 or 10. I read that sentence as I won't be there until later. So I responded that I'm on at 7 for what it's worth, which I now realize was totally weird because she already said the time she'd be there, but I completely misread that entire sentence, like I didn't even see the correct words. This happens quite often. I also type incorrect words all the time, and I reverse the order of words when I type. They aren't typos, I use the correct letters, but I put the words in the wrong order without realizing it, and I will often type entirely different words than I intend to, but they are always words that are close to the word I meant to type. It's all very weird. I have no trouble speaking, I have a pretty great vocabulary, I'm very articulate, but I constantly fuck up reading and writing, and have avoided books and printed word my entire life. Reading is like a tortuous chore for me. I CAN read, I'm not illiterate, but anything more than a quick social media post or sign, anything of significant length, jumbles my brain and I hate it.... I also completely shut down when it comes to math and numbers, and the more I think about it, I just generally cannot handle large amounts of similar-looking items. I can't ever find what I'm looking for. I remember working at Starbucks when I was a teenager and I could never find the correct button on the register. They were all white squares on a blue background and I literally could not find the one I needed no matter how hard I tried, but then someone would point it out to me, and it's like it would materialize out of thin air. I've always been really really bad at finding one object amongst similar objects. Even looking for a brand of beer at the store. I recently had to stare at the fridge for like 5 mins scanning back and forth until I found the one I needed, and it was in a spot I had already looked at a few times, but then it suddenly appears. It's so weird. Does this sound like some amount of dyslexia?","Dyslexia Variability: Here are some insights:

"I got held back a year twice when I was younger, in part because of dyslexia but mainly because of a medical condition that made me miss a lot of school. I'm 19 in a week and still have another 2 years left in school. This year will be the first year where there'll be no one else my age in the whole school, and I'm worried about how it's going to be like. Up to now, being held back hasn't affected me all that much as even if I've had to go to classes with younger kids than me, at breaks and lunch time there were guys I knew my age from my original school year I could hang out with. Now those guys have graduated school and are getting jobs or going to uni. Getting held back was years ago, it was just something that happened, I didn't have a say in it myself. It didn't change my school life all that much at the time. I never really had much interaction with others in my class as I had to sit with the special needs lady or go to additional learning. This is the first time I've properly had to face the impact that it's having on my life, I'm going to be still in school for two more years while everyone else my age is already an adult.

"I have diagnosed dyslexia and PTSD, mentioning that to help give some context. Do any of you experience full-on anxiety attacks when you make a mistake caused by dyslexia and others notice it? Here are a couple of examples of things that have happened to me: In a group message, I reminded everyone to bring snakes on the trip instead of snacks. I read the message back to myself at least five or six times and still didn’t catch the mistake. Someone made a joke about it, and I ended up feeling really bad about it off and on for about a week. I mixed up Tuesday and Thursday while trying to reschedule an appointment. I went back and read our text messages multiple times, and it clearly said Thursday, but my brain was convinced it said Tuesday. I panicked and tried to reschedule, only to realize the appointment was never on the wrong day to begin with. Even though nothing actually went wrong, I still feel awful for bothering someone over a mistake that only existed in my head.

"Denied IEP for dyslexia based on discrepancy model (scores/achievement too high). The team kept bringing up anxiety as a reason for my daughter's behaviors. Why would they do this? I didn't want them pinning her difficulties on anxiety/emotional disturbance as I've experienced with doctors over the years with my son and me (when it was really ADHD). Yes, she can read, and yes, she is smart, but she cannot read automatically or fluently, or with comprehension without returning to the text a million times. Of course, that causes her to get anxious when testing or reading out loud, and about going to school in general. Or were they trying to give me a reason for a 504?... Shouldn't we be calling it what it is? Dyslexia? (and maybe dysgraphia and dyscalculia too?)","IEP and 504 Plans: Here are some considerations:
Discrepancy Model: Schools might use this model to determine eligibility for special education services.
Anxiety: Anxiety can be a secondary effect of dyslexia, but it shouldn't be the primary focus.
Advocacy: Advocate for a comprehensive assessment that considers dyslexia, dysgraphia, and dyscalculia.
504 Plan: A 504 plan can provide accommodations without the need for special education services.

"My son who is now a freshman in high has ADHD, anxiety and dyslexia. He has been struggling since day one with school work, reading and writing and even more complex math. Unfortunately we don’t have the best school system and despite IEP’s, advocates, tutors he is still way behind and has zero motivation to do good in school (like I’m afraid he won’t pass freshman year let alone graduate HS). I tried the basic ADHD meds when he was younger but it made him so anxious that we stopped them pretty quickly. He is currently taking Venlafaxine which is technically an anxiety medication that could help with some of the focus issues. My question is, has anyone actually found any medications to be helpful with learning when you are dyslexic? Also any advice on how to motivate a child to want to succeed?","Medications: Here are some insights:
Stimulants: Some individuals with ADHD and dyslexia find stimulants like Ritalin or Adderall helpful for focus, but they can increase anxiety.
Non-Stimulants: Medications like Atomoxetine (Strattera) might be less likely to cause anxiety.
Anxiety Medications: SSRIs or SNRIs like Venlafaxine can help with anxiety, potentially improving focus indirectly.
Consultation: Consult with a psychiatrist or neurologist experienced in treating ADHD and dyslexia for personalized advice.
Motivation: Here are some strategies:
Interest-Based Learning: Incorporate his interests into learning to increase engagement.
Positive Reinforcement: Focus on positive reinforcement rather than punishment.
Goal Setting: Set small, achievable goals to build momentum and confidence.
Support: Seek support from local dyslexia associations or online communities for shared experiences.
Advocacy: Advocate for him by explaining his needs to educators and seeking accommodations."
"I (F19) have had anxiety my whole life, when I was 7 I was diagnosed with ADHD as well. I found school really really hard mentally always feeling dumber than my classmates. I was a shy kid because of it and dreaded school. When I got to high school it was much the same until at 14 I was also diagnosed with dyslexia and told that I wasn't ADHD (I had been on Ritalin for years at this point), in a way I am grateful for it as I know it makes my thinking unique. My worry is how I will be perceived in the workplace as I am about to finish uni, I always spell check everything but stuff always manages to slip through, and I don't want people to question my intelligence. I feel like I always have to prove it, I also think I am really reliant on validation from others, I think it's a result of the lack of validation and marks I got throughout my education. Does anyone have the same combo, and any tips with how you cope because god it's hard and no one seems to get it?","Workplace Perception: Here are some strategies:

"Today, while I was doing an A lab in my AP Chemistry class, I really started stressing. When I get worried, my dyslexia gets exponentially worse, causing me to re-read paragraphs tons of time with no actual takeaway. It makes it impossible for me to finish the work, and I always have to do stuff at home. Just wondering if anyone else experiences this type of thing and if they have a fix/method to aid it?","Stress Management: Here are some strategies:

"My SO really wants to take a certification test but gets overwhelmed by reading the study material and keeps pushing off the test for this or that reason. I used to put little encouraging notes in his study stuff and even researched his certification and found some video resources for him to use in lieu of reading a book. I also made him some flash cards. He stopped studying a month or so in each time he gets himself hyped about it. He said he had a lot of trouble in school and has not passed the test before so studying sometimes makes him recall that time when he kept messing up due to his dyslexia and his anxiety goes sky high. He has taken meds before but doesn't want to take anything or see a counselor. There are so many dyslexics that had trouble in school. What did you do to overcome that negative association when you needed to study again? What helps you keep calm when you get anxious? I want to support his career goals but I don't know how to be there for him. If he doesn't want to do it that is one thing but he keeps bringing up studying for it or passing it when he talks about his future plans so I know he wants it.","Overcoming Negative Associations: Here are some strategies:

"I’ve had times in school where I am doing a math problem or trying to read something. If my anxiety heightens from feeling embarrassed, it can make the words or numbers change. I swear I was trying to read this poster on the wall of my classroom when my anxiety was bad and it looked like Spanish! Like honest to god Spanish with the ~ over the N and everything! Once I calmed down, I looked back and it was a simple saying like eat clean, study hard, dream big or something like that. Anyone else had this?","Anxiety-Induced Dyslexia: Here are some insights:
